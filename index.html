            <h1>What is react?</h1>
            <p>React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI
                components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React
                can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications</p>

        <div class="def">
            <h1>Spa vs Mpa</h1>
            <h2>SAP</h2>
            <li>Speed is an important factor here – people’s attention spans are getting shorter, and we get more and
                more impatient. SPA’s load faster. Why? As it &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loads the majority of app
                resources just once. The page doesn’t reload entirely whenever the user requests a new piece of data.
            </li><br>
            <li>Needless to say, it is the need of the hour to optimize the web app for search engines. It is difficult
                for the search engine bots to crawl the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dynamic content of the SPA. And because
                of this, it is difficult
                to index the SPA.</li><br>
            <li>As compared to multi-page apps, SPA is more vulnerable to hackers’ attacks. The reason being the use of
                cross-site scripting (XSS). The attacker &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can easily insert their code on the
                client-side and perform
                malicious actions.</li><br>
            <li>A good user experience is no longer an option but a requirement. SPA’s are more mobile-friendly, and
                it’s something worth remembering as a lot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of traffic comes from mobile devices.
                Even Google started to
                prioritize mobile experience over the desktop. Frameworks applied in SPA
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development enable you to
                develop mobile apps. </li><br>

            <h2>MAP</h2>
            <li>MPA is slower as the browser must reload the entire page from scratch whenever the user wants to access
                new data or moves to a different part &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the website. The optimal loading time
                for a website is 0.4 seconds. If your website or app is image-heavy, then choosing a SPA is a safer
                option. </li><br>
            <li>On running down a comparison between single-page applications vs. multi-page applications in terms of
                SEO, then MPA definitely holds a higher &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spot. MPA has the advantage of splitting
                the content across
                pages and thereby stuffing more high-relevance keywords into the structure. This
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;helps in crawling and
                thus increases the chances of ranking high on the search engines.</li><br>
            <li>MPAs have better security features and integrity of data.</li><br>
            <li>MPA’s, on the other hand, enable better information architecture. You can create as many pages as
                required, and you can include as much &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information on a page as you need
                without any limits. Navigation
                is clear, so the user can easily find their way around the website, which
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;positively impacts their
                experience. </li>

            <h1>Angular vs React</h1>
            <h2>React</h2>
            <li>Allows you to use 3rd party libraries</li>
            <li>Better user experience and very fast performance.</li>
            <li>React Components</li>
            <li>Faster Development</li>
            <li>Code Stability with One-directional data binding</li>

            <h2>Angular</h2>
            <li>Built-in support for AJAX, HTTP, and Observables</li>
            <li>Cleaner and crisp Coding</li>
            <li>Shadow DOM / local CSS</li>
            <li>Seamless updates using Angular CLI</li>

        <div class="def">
            <h1>library vs Framework</h1>
            <h2>library</h2>
            <li>A Library is a set of code that was previously written by a developer that you can call when you are
                building your project.</li>

            <li> In Library, you import or call specific methods that you need for your project.</li>
            <br>
            <li> In simple words, a bunch of code packed together that can be used repeatedly is known as Library.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Reusability is one of the main reasons to use libraries.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Let's understand this more clearly with the help of an example.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Think of you as a carpenter who needs to build a table.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Now, you can build a table without the help of tools, but it's time-consuming and a long process.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Whereas, if you choose the correct tools, you'll be able to build a table more quickly and that too
                without any hardship.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Think of here tools as a library. You can write your program without them.</li>
            <br>
            <li> But it will be a long process, and chances are your program will get buggy, while if you use Library,
                it'll be much easier for you to work with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the program. </li>


            <h2>Framework</h2>
            <li>A framework is a supporting structure that gives shape to your code.</li>
            <br>
            <li> In the Framework, you have to fill the structure accordingly with your code.</li>
            <br>
            <li> There is a specific structure for a particular framework that you have to follow, and it's generally
                more restrictive than Library.</li>
            <br>
            <li>One thing to remember here is that frameworks sometimes get quite large, so they may also use the
                Library.</li>
            <br>
            <li> But the Framework doesn't necessarily have to use Library.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Let's get back to our carpenter and table example for a better understanding of the Framework.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Here, if you want to build a table, then you need a model or skeleton for how the table looks, like the
                table has four legs and a top slab.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Now, this is the core structure of the table and you have to work accordingly to build the table.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Similar to this, Framework also provides the structure, and you have to write the code accordingly.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li> Let's take the example of Express and understand the restrictive nature of the Framework. </li>

            <h1>real Dom vs Virtual dom</h1>
            <h2>Dom</h2>
            <p>DOM takes all the HTML elements and wraps them in an object with a tree-structure — like the image above.
                This provides an API that allows us to directly target any specific node (HTML element) and do what we
                want like adding more child/parent nodes, removing, editing it’s content </p>
            <h2>Virtual dom</h2>
            <p>On the other hand, Virtual DOM is an abstraction of your Real DOM but it’s pretty light-weight than the
                Real DOM — It has all the same properties as the Real DOM object but it can’t write and show things to
                the screen like Real DOM. It’s extremely fast as compared to the Browser’s DOM — It can produce about
                200,000 Virtual DOM Nodes / Second </p>

            <h1>Oneway Data Binding vs Two way</h1>
            <h2>Oneway Data Binding</h2>
            <li>In one-way binding, the data flow is one-directional.</li>
            <br>
            <li>This means that the flow of code is from typescript file to Html file.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In order to achieve a one-way binding, we used the property binding concept in Angular.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In property binding, we encapsulate the variable in Html with square brackets( [ ] ).</li>
            <br>
            <li>We will understand this concept through an example in order to make it more comprehensible.</li>

            <h2>Two way</h2>
            <li>in a two-way binding, the data flow is bi-directional.</li>
            <br>
            <li>This means that the flow of code is from ts file to Html file as well as from Html file to ts file.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In order to achieve a two-way binding, we will use ngModel or banana in a box syntax.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To bind two properties in order to two-way binding works, declare the ngModel directive and set it equal
                to the name of the proper</li>
            <br>
            <li>We will understand the concept through an example in order to make it more comprehensible.</li>
